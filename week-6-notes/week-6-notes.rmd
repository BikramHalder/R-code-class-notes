### R-code notes compilation for  Week 6, February 22th and 25th

```{r}
runningmean <- function(x, N) {
  y <- sample(x, N, replace = TRUE)
  # THIS samples N points wih replacement
  c <- cumsum(y)
  # cumulative sums of the 1st i values in i th position
  n <- 1:N
  c / n
  # Division is vectorised, mean of 1st i values of y is in ith position
}
```

Simulating $1000$ trials of $Ber(\frac{1}{2})$

The $1000$ $Ber(\frac{1}{2})$ variables being $X_1,X_2, \ldots ,X_{1000}$,

```{r}
u <- runningmean(c(0, 1), 1000)
```

The function returns the mean of the first $i$ random variables in the $i^{th}$ place.
, i.e., ```u[i]``` = $\frac{X_1+X_2+...+X_i}{i}$

We "guess" the value of ```u[i]``` will converge to $\frac{1}{2}$ as
```i``` gets really large. (It should converge with probability $1$)
